# SurvEye 
## A Gaze-Based Questionnaire for Individuals with Manual Difficulties

SurvEye is a project that aims to provide accessible digital questionnaires for people with manual difficulties. The goal within the scope of my Bachelor's Thesis is to investigate different questionnaire designs to retrieve design recommendations for gaze-based questionnaires and provide developers with reusable components to faciliate the creation of gaze-based questionnaires. In the future, it would be desirable to incorporate this work into a questionnaire tool for researchers, where they can easily assemble their questionnaire and generate both mouse-based and gaze-based versions of the questionnaire to distribute among their study participants.

This project was created with the use of [Webgazer](https://github.com/brownhci/WebGazer), a JavaScript library for eye tracking. 

SurvEye consists of:
1. A mouse-free calibration sequence to calibrate the eye tracking technology
2. An optional validation sequence where accuracy is being measured
3. A Questionnaire consisting of different layouts and interaction element designs 

A demonstration of the current state of SurvEye can be found [here](https://relaxed-sinoussi-3ccc09.netlify.app).
